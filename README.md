# Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot is a computer program designed to interact with users within the Telegram messaging platform. These bots can perform a wide range of tasks, from providing information and answering questions to automating processes and facilitating various forms of engagement. Telegram bots can be integrated into group chats or function as standalone entities, and they can be created for diverse purposes, such as customer support, content delivery, gaming, or productivity enhancement.

Users can interact with Telegram bots by sending text commands or engaging with predefined buttons and menus. Telegram bot developers leverage Telegram's Bot API to build and deploy these automated agents, making them accessible to millions of Telegram users worldwide.
